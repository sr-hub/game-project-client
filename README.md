This is my README! Stay tuned for updates. -S

List technologies used:
  HTML5
  CSS
  Bootstrap
  JS

Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy:
  I started with the game-logic and click events. After basic functionality, I worked with the api to ensure all of the basic user account functions. Then I took a swing at finalizing slightly higher level functions (delcaration of winners/ties, stopping the game). Lastly, I made sure the game board was connected to the game api, to make sure games and player actions are databased.


List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations:
  Beautification.
  Multiplayer.
  Getting an individual game.
  Displaying old games as game boards.
